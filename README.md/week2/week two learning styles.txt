It was interesting to me to see that the VARK test really exposed a lie in a really common theory, that even I personally believed- that learning styles are more or less not really a thing. This is really interesting to me because like it said in the article I have had a lot of people in my life talk about how their learning style affects how they do in school, and honestly, I have agreed. For me personally, I do believe that it is a real thing, I think that everyone's brains are wired differently, for some they are able to read and comprehend information a lot easier than hearing it out loud, or vice versa. For me, I prefer to hear them out loud. I also like to use pictures or charts to memorize information opposed to writing it down. For me these are the types of learning styles I find most effective, but the article says that there is really no difference except in the way that your brain WANTS to interpret the information. 
I think that the article does have a point in that though, of course some information I will not want to interpret, so making a different way in my brain is the reason for interpreting it as a learning style, possibly simply because I may be too lazy in the moment. I am on the fence about what I really believe, the article did give really good advice in saying that repetition and study sessions are beneficial, or learning the information in multiple ways, or all ways, instead of deciding that your brain does not want to form a connection in all ways. 
Overall, despite what the article says I do believe people do have different learning styles in the way that by knowing what works best in your brain to form connections, allows you to learn faster. If you struggle with reading and prefer to hear it, I believe that you should learn the way it is best for you or the way you save yourself the most energy.
